On-chain analysis is working with data from the blockchain itself: transactions, wallets, asset movements. If technical analysis shows *how* price moves, on-chain explains *why* it happens. For traders, on-chain metrics are part of fundamental analysis: they help assess cycle context, overheating or undervaluation zones, and behavior of large players. This article covers key metrics to track and how not to overestimate their role.

## Why Traders Need On-Chain Data

Blockchain is a public ledger: all transfers, balances, and coin movements are recorded there. On-chain analysis reveals traces of large players, accumulation zones, and signals that appear on the chart with delay or not at all. It doesn't replace technical analysis, but complements it: helps choose entry or exit timing, position size, and aggression level. On-chain sets cycle context and participant sentiment; specific entry and exit points are still found by levels, indicators, and volume on the chart.

**Advantages of on-chain analysis:**
- Transparency: all data from public blockchain
- Less delay than chart: large transfers visible immediately
- Context: understanding who moves the market (whales, retail, exchanges)
- False signal filter: TA + on-chain = fewer false entries

**Limitations:**
- Not all transactions are signals (there are internal transfers, OTC)
- Data may lag by several blocks
- Aggregated metrics smooth the picture
- Requires interpretation in context

## Five On-Chain Metrics for Fundamental Context

### 1. Exchange Flows (Inflows/Outflows)

Large transfers on blockchain often set market direction.

- **Coins flowing to exchanges** — "for sale" supply increases; correction or price pressure possible.
- **Coins leaving exchanges to wallets** — accumulation; participants less ready to sell, liquidity "locked up."

Services like Glassnode or CryptoQuant show exchange balances and flows. Not every large transaction is a signal: there are internal transfers, market-makers, arbitrage. Look at trend and volume, not single transaction.

**Example:** If 50,000+ BTC left exchanges in a week, this is accumulation signal. If 30,000+ BTC arrived — potential price pressure.

### 2. MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value)

MVRV compares market capitalization with "realized" value of coins (by price of last movement). Essentially — how much the market values asset above or below average acquisition price.

- **MVRV < 1** — market price below "realized"; many holding at loss. Often interpreted as undervaluation or capitulation zone.
- **MVRV > 3-3.5** — strong overheating; many in profit, temptation to take profit grows. Correction risk higher.

MVRV doesn't give exact "buy/sell" point, but sets context: in MVRV < 1 zone it's wiser to look for long setups and not overload short; at MVRV > 3 — be more careful adding to long and watch for distribution signs on chart.

**Historical data:**
- 2018 bottom: MVRV ≈ 0.8
- 2021 peak: MVRV ≈ 3.8
- 2022 bottom (FTX): MVRV ≈ 0.9

### 3. SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio)

SOPR shows whether participants are selling at profit or loss (by average price of "spent" outputs).

- **SOPR > 1** — profit taking; many sellers in profit, market may cool down.
- **SOPR < 1** — loss sales; often associated with capitulation and possible bounce.

Like MVRV, SOPR is better used as sentiment filter, not sole trigger. Combination with technical analysis (levels, volume, [RSI](https://Felag-academy.org/en/library/technical-analysis-rsi/)) gives more stable decisions.

**Variations:**
- **aSOPR (adjusted SOPR)** — excludes transactions shorter than 1 hour (noise)
- **SOPR by groups** — separately for whales (>1000 BTC), sharks (100-1000 BTC), retail

### 4. Futures Risk Zones (Liquidations)

On futures markets, positions accumulate under which liquidations "hang." Analyzing these zones helps assess sharp move risk.

- **Many long positions under liquidation threat** — on price drop, cascade liquidation and acceleration of fall possible.
- **Shorts on verge of liquidation** — on rise, short-squeeze and sharp bounce up possible.

Liquidation data available, for example, on Coinglass. Useful to consider when choosing position size and stop-losses, not as replacement for own trading system.

**Example:** If $500M of short liquidations accumulated at $95,000 level, on breakout above $95,000 sharp jump to $98,000-100,000 possible due to chain reaction of position closures.

### 5. Large Holder Activity

Tracking wallets of large holders and flows into new projects shows where capital is moving. Large investors accumulating asset — possible interest signal; mass withdrawal into new token — focus shift. Such data available in Nansen, Arkham and similar services. Interpret with caution: "whales" can create false traces or act in market-making interests.

**Holder classification:**
- **Whales:** >1,000 BTC (or equivalent)
- **Sharks:** 100-1,000 BTC
- **Fish:** 10-100 BTC
- **Retail:** <10 BTC

## Metrics for Altcoins: What to Watch

Altcoins have their specifics. Here are key metrics:

### 1. TVL (Total Value Locked)

**What it is:** Total value of tokens locked in DeFi protocol.

**Where to check:** DefiLlama, Token Terminal

**Interpretation:**
- TVL rising → interest in protocol growing
- TVL falling → users leaving

**Example:**
- Uniswap TVL: $3B → $4B (+33%)
- Conclusion: interest in protocol growing, can consider long UNI token

### 2. Revenue (Protocol Revenue)

**What it is:** Fees generated by protocol.

**Where to check:** Token Terminal, DefiLlama

**Interpretation:**
- Revenue rising → protocol earning
- Revenue falling → interest declining

**P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings):**
- Market cap / Annual revenue
- P/E < 10: undervalued
- P/E > 50: overvalued

**Example:**
- AAVE: Market Cap $1.5B, Revenue $50M/year
- P/E = 30 (medium valuation)

### 3. Active Addresses

**What it is:** Number of unique addresses using protocol.

**Where to check:** Glassnode, Dune Analytics

**Interpretation:**
- Addresses rising → adoption growing
- Addresses falling → interest declining

**Example:**
- Arbitrum: 100,000 → 200,000 addresses/day (+100%)
- Conclusion: mass adoption, can consider long ARB

### 4. Token Unlocks

**What it is:** Calendar of token unlocks for team, investors, community.

**Where to check:** TokenUnlocks.app, Vesting trackers

**Interpretation:**
- Large unlock in 7 days → risk of price pressure
- No unlocks for 3+ months → safe

**Example:**
- Aptos: 11.1M tokens unlocked October 15
- Price: -20% in week after unlock

## Practical Examples: How to Use On-Chain in Trading

### Example 1: Buying at Bottom (November 2022)

**Situation:** FTX collapse, market panic.

**On-chain signals:**
- MVRV: 0.95 (< 1, capitulation zone) ✅
- SOPR: 0.85 (< 1, mass losses) ✅
- Exchange reserves: +200,000 BTC per week (panic) ❌
- Whale activity: outflow from exchanges 50,000 BTC ✅

**Decision:**
- 3 of 4 signals indicate bottom
- Entry: $16,000-17,000
- Stop-loss: $15,000
- Take-profit: $25,000 (50%+)

**Result:**
- Bottom: $15,500 (November 2022)
- 3 months later: $30,000 (+93%)

### Example 2: Selling at Peak (November 2021)

**Situation:** BTC updates all-time high.

**On-chain signals:**
- MVRV: 3.8 (> 3, overheating zone) ❌
- SOPR: 1.5 (> 1, mass profit taking) ❌
- Exchange reserves: +100,000 BTC in 2 weeks (whales selling) ❌
- Whale activity: mass outflow to stablecoins ❌

**Decision:**
- 4 of 4 signals indicate overheating
- Take profit: $65,000-69,000
- Move to stablecoins (USDT, USDC)

**Result:**
- Peak: $69,000 (November 2021)
- 12 months later: $15,500 (-77%)

### Example 3: Altseason (2024)

**Situation:** BTC rising, dominance falling.

**On-chain signals:**
- BTC Power: falling from 55% to 45% ✅
- ETH/BTC Ratio: rising from 0.05 to 0.08 ✅
- Altcoin TVL: +50% per month ✅
- Altcoin active addresses: +100% ✅

**Decision:**
- Rotation from BTC to altcoins
- Buy: ETH, SOL, AVAX, ARB
- Stop-loss: -15%
- Take-profit: +50-100%

**Result:**
- ETH: +80% in 2 months
- SOL: +150% in 2 months
- ARB: +200% in 2 months

## Limitations of On-Chain Analysis

**Important to understand:**

1. **Not all transactions are signals**
   - Internal transfers between wallets
   - OTC deals (off exchanges)
   - Market-making

2. **Data may lag**
   - MVRV, SOPR: 1-2 days delay
   - Exchange reserves: real-time, but not all exchanges transparent

3. **Aggregated metrics smooth the picture**
   - MVRV for whole network ≠ MVRV for whales
   - Look at metrics by holder groups

4. **Manipulations possible**
   - Whales can create false traces
   - Mass transfers to exchanges ≠ always selling

**How to reduce risks:**
- Combine 3+ metrics (don't rely on one)
- Use with technical analysis (levels, volume)
- Check context (news, narratives)
- Watch long-term trend (don't panic from single signal)

## Summary

On-chain analysis is powerful tool for understanding market context and large player behavior. Combine it with technical analysis for complete picture.

**Key takeaways:**
- On-chain shows "why" price moves, TA shows "how"
- Key metrics: MVRV, SOPR, exchange flows, whale activity
- Use NuNet for quick context, Glassnode for deep dive
- Combine 3+ metrics for confirmation
- Don't rely solely on on-chain for entry/exit

## FAQ

**What are on-chain metrics?**

Data from blockchain itself: transactions, wallet balances, exchange flows, holder activity. They show what participants are doing inside the network.

**Where to check on-chain metrics?**

- Glassnode: MVRV, SOPR, exchange balances
- CryptoQuant: exchange reserves, flows, whales
- Nansen: whale wallets, smart money
- TokenUnlocks: token unlock calendars

**How to interpret MVRV?**

- MVRV < 1: undervaluation (many in loss) — consider buying
- MVRV 1-2: neutral zone
- MVRV > 3: overheating (many in profit) — consider taking profit

**What are exchange flows telling?**

- Outflow from exchanges: accumulation (bullish)
- Inflow to exchanges: potential selling (bearish)
- Look at trend, not single transaction

**Can I trade only by on-chain?**

No. On-chain doesn't give exact entry points. Use with technical analysis: on-chain for context, TA for timing.

**How often to check on-chain metrics?**

- Top-10 assets: once per week
- Top-100 assets: once per 2 weeks
- Before major events: always check (unlocks, upgrades, regulations)

**What is SOPR?**

Spent Output Profit Ratio — shows whether sellers are in profit or loss. SOPR > 1: profit taking, SOPR < 1: loss sales (capitulation).

**Are whale movements reliable signals?**

Not always. Whales can create false traces or act in market-making interests. Combine with other metrics and context.

**What is NuNet?**

On-chain metric aggregator that combines multiple metrics into single indicators (URC, BTC Power, ETH/BTC Ratio). Good for quick context, less depth than individual metrics.

**How to use on-chain for altcoins?**

Watch TVL (DefiLlama), revenue (Token Terminal), active addresses (Glassnode), token unlocks (TokenUnlocks.app). Combine with BTC dominance and ETH/BTC ratio for altseason timing.
