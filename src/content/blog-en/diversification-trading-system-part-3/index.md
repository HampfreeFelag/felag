A system on paper and a system in practice are not the same. It's important to monitor it, adjust when needed, and not repeat common mistakes.

In this part — tuning for yourself and what to avoid. Previous parts: [Part 1](https://felag.online/en/library/diversification-trading-system-part-1/) (why diversify), [Part 2](https://felag.online/en/library/diversification-trading-system-part-2/) (how to build rules and configure bots).

## Monitoring and reporting

It makes sense to check periodically: overall PnL and drawdown, bot execution (do orders fire by the rules, any API failures). If a bot doesn't open or close positions when conditions are met — possible misconfiguration or exchange API issue. Simple tracking — at least in a spreadsheet or platform reports — helps see which strategy or bot is performing and what to tune or turn off. How often to check depends on your timeframe: for daily strategies once a day or week is enough; for more active ones — more often.

**Keeping a trading journal**

For systematic trade tracking, it's recommended to keep a trading journal. This can be a paper notebook, a spreadsheet, or a specialized platform. At Market Lab, we use [TMM](https://felag.online/en/library/trading-journal-guide/) for automatic statistics collection and trade analysis.

## When and how to tune

Don't change rules after one trade: one drawdown or one profit is not a reason to rewrite the system. Tuning — after a period (week, month): if the system is steadily in the red or drawdown exceeds what you accept, then revising parameters is justified. Before changing settings, test the new configuration on history — [backtests](https://felag.online/en/library/what-are-backtests/) show how the system would have behaved in the past. Otherwise you risk fitting to past data and overfitting: nice on history, drawdown again in live.

## Common mistakes

- **Too many positions** — too many bots or pairs at once; one drawdown drags the whole portfolio. It makes sense to limit the number of simultaneous positions (position lock on the platform or a manual cap).
- **Ignoring stop losses** — "I'll wait for a bounce" instead of closing by the rule; risk of losing control of risk and blurring system rules.
- **No diversification** — all volume in one asset, one bot, or one exchange; one failure hits all capital. See [Part 1](https://felag.online/en/library/diversification-trading-system-part-1/).
- **Chasing the market** — increasing size or aggression after a string of winning trades; often leads to overtrading and drawdown when the market turns.

## Pre-launch checklist

Before putting the system in "live" mode, check:

- Entry and exit rules are written and clear; risk per trade is set and not exceeded.
- Bots are configured, position and pair limits match diversification (assets, strategies, venues).
- Venues checked: uptime, withdrawal limits, reputation — see [exchange uptime and downtime](https://felag.online/en/library/exchange-uptime-downtime/).
- Key scenarios tested on history (backtest) where possible.

## Series wrap-up

Diversification is part of trading system setup: by assets, strategies, and venues (Part 1). The system is entry/exit rules, position size and risk (Part 2). In practice it's important to monitor results, tune thoughtfully, and not repeat common mistakes (Part 3).

## Summary

Briefly: the key points are above; use them as a practical checklist and combine with risk management.

## FAQ

**How often to check the system?**

For daily strategies — once a day/week. For scalping — more often, every day.

**When to change system settings?**

After a period (week, month), not after one trade. If system is steadily in red — revision is justified.

**What is system overfitting?**

When you tune parameters to past data — looks good on history, drawdown again live.

**Why shouldn't I ignore stop losses?**

"Wait for a bounce" blurs system rules and leads to losing risk control.

**How many assets in portfolio is enough?**

Minimum 3–5 assets, distributed by capital. More — better diversification.
