Risk management is the foundation of successful crypto trading, especially when using automated systems. Practice shows that ignoring or careless approach to risk management leads traders to losses or even complete deposit loss. In this article, we cover practical risk management when working with trading bots.

## What is Risk Management in Trading

**Risk management in trading** is a system of rules that allows a trader to limit losses and protect their deposit. In volatile markets like crypto, where one wrong decision can cost a significant part of capital, following risk management is essential.

Understanding how risk management works is a prerequisite for sustainable capital growth. Without proper capital protection, a trader risks losing their deposit in just a few trades.

## Why It's Important to Consider Risks in Crypto

Risk management in crypto is becoming more relevant due to market instability and unpredictability. No loss limits, excessive risk, and ignoring entry/exit rules are the main causes of losses. Remember: safe crypto trading is impossible without strict adherence to risk management principles.

## Core Principles of Risk Management

Trading often mentions the "golden rule" of 1-2% risk per trade: don't risk more than this share of your deposit in a single trade. We follow a slightly different approach: capital is distributed across many assets and strategies, meaning it's constantly at work. Our risk per idea is slightly higher (around 2.5%), but thanks to strict diversification and clear exit rules, we consider this approach no less safe — and in some conditions even safer. It has helped us survive multiple corrections without breaking the system.

- **Cap risk per trade/cycle.** Set a maximum loss for one idea or one bot cycle and don't exceed it.
- **Setting stop-losses.** The limit allows you to cut losses early, before the market turns against you. Read more about stop-losses in the article about [trailing stop](https://Felag-academy.org/en/library/what-is-trailing-stop).
- **Asset diversification.** Distributing capital between different tokens helps reduce overall portfolio volatility. Learn more about combining asset diversification, strategies, and platforms in the series [Diversification and Trading System Setup](https://Felag-academy.org/en/library/diversification-trading-system-part-1/).

All these measures form the basis of money management rules and allow even a beginner to calculate risk management in trading.

## Practice: Keeping a Trade Journal

One effective tool for risk management control is keeping a trading journal. Trade tracking helps analyze mistakes, monitor progress, and maintain discipline.

There are specialized platforms for trade tracking, such as [TraderMake.Money](https://tradermake.money/ru/trader/Felag/?ref=Jx9LLm). At Market Lab, we use TMM in test mode to analyze our own trading on one of our Bybit subaccounts (public data since 14.02.2026).

## How to Use Risk Management When Trading with Bots

Risk management in crypto trading with automated systems includes precise parameters: position size, entry and exit levels, maximum allowable drawdown. The bot works according to specified conditions, but the trader is responsible for configuring them.

You also need to determine in advance: how much capital to give to the bot, where to set stop-loss and take-profit, and what loss limits are acceptable within the strategy. When trading with bots, the risk management process is much simpler — you essentially exclude emotional decisions and errors. You just need to have your working risk management, and let the crypto bot handle execution.

### Practical Example of Capital Allocation

Let's look at a practical approach to capital allocation when working with trading bots. For example, we have $100. We start with a 1:1 ratio to smoothly enter the process. All strategies are based on a small budget — first we test the system on a small amount, then scale it.

If we keep a 1:1 ratio:

- **$50 — for bots**, $50 — buffer (reserve).
- **The $50 for bots** can be divided into blocks. A block will be set by the number of bots — for example, 5 bots, $10 for each bot.

This significantly reduces risks. The concept is simple: "We cannot predict the movement of each asset, but we can create a system where their combined movement produces results."

### System Scaling

When working with large lists of 3-4 subaccounts and more than 200 assets, the system becomes even more stable. Then we simply scale the system: increase the number of assets or increase the bot deposit. This system continues to work with a slightly larger deposit, growing turnover from week to week. Thus, the deposit grows geometrically.

Advantages of this approach:

- **Many assets, exchanges, and subaccounts** — we don't worry about individual investments
- **Diversified portfolio** — assets with different characteristics and correlations
- **Assets on different blockchains** — protection against economic events in one network

All you need to do is observe how the system works, open blocks or increase bot deposits as capital grows.

## Bot Settings to Minimize Risks

When configuring trading bots, it's important to follow several key principles:

- **It is recommended to set the price range overlap around 20-30%.** With correct entry points, this is enough; the system will work in the specified range without excessive risk.

- **It makes sense to set the martingale percentage in the grid of orders from 5% and higher.** This helps to get profit on smaller price rebounds. The higher the martingale percentage, the smaller price rebound is needed for profit.

- **It makes sense to focus on smaller profit percentage (0.5-1%).** Several closed cycles with profit less than 1% are often better than one unfinished cycle with potential profit of 1.5%.

### Deposit Allocation

It is recommended to divide the deposit into parts to trade in different pairs and with multiple bots:

- **Pay attention to reliable cryptocurrencies.** If part of the deposit is allocated to trading such assets, profit may not be high but stable and predictable.

- **You can allocate part for promising cryptocurrency trading.** Even if the price changes significantly, there's an opportunity to trade in the opposite direction while the price returns to close the original trade with profit.

### Selecting Trading Pairs

Trading pairs should be chosen carefully:

- It makes sense to choose a well-known cryptocurrency that you find promising and reliable.
- It's important not to concentrate capital on cheap and unknown coins — they often change in price significantly and for a long time.

### Using Filters for Bot Start

It makes sense not to ignore filters for bot start. They are responsible for bots not starting to buy too early and expensively or sell too early and cheaply.

Trading signals and indicators are used to configure filters:

- **RSI, CCI, Bollinger Bands, MACD, EMA** — reflect the relative strength of the trend. Learn more about the [RSI indicator](https://Felag-academy.org/en/library/technical-analysis-rsi) and other technical analysis tools.
- **24-hour trading volume indicator** — you shouldn't trade a coin whose trading volume over the past 24 hours is too low. To track this indicator, you can pay attention to the liquidity coefficient of the trading asset.

## Psychology and Self-Discipline of a Trader

Trading psychology is no less important for success than technical analysis. Fear, greed, and the desire to "win back" can destroy even a perfect strategy. Emotional resilience, understanding your risk profile as a trader, and maintaining discipline are not just desirable but extremely necessary.

It is self-control that allows you not to break the strategy and not deviate from the pre-set plan. When working with bots, the emotional factor is minimized, but this doesn't mean you can completely ignore trading psychology.

## Typical Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

Common mistakes of most crypto traders:

- **Trading without stop-losses** — one of the most dangerous mistakes. Even when trading with bots, you need to set a maximum drawdown at which the bot stops working.
- **Excessive risk per trade** — exceeding the chosen limit for one idea/cycle. If you determined 2.5% risk per trade, don't increase it "as an exception."
- **Lack of clear strategy/diversification** — concentration on one asset, one exchange, or one strategy. More on the correct approach in the series [Diversification and Trading System Setup](https://Felag-academy.org/en/library/diversification-trading-system-part-1/).
- **Ignoring analytics** — trading without market analysis, without keeping a trade journal. Statistics help understand which setups work and which don't.
- **Overtrading** — the desire to "win back" after a loss or increase volume after a series of profits. Emotional decisions destroy the system.
- **No monitoring** — "set and forget." Bots require periodic checks: order execution, API operation, configuration correctness.

All this can lead to irreversible losses and deposit drain. To reduce risks, it's important to understand how to calculate risk management in trading and stick to the chosen rules. It's also recommended to regularly analyze your trading mistakes and, based on this, adjust the trading system, risk management, and automated solutions.

## Using Backtests for Optimization

Before launching a bot on a real account, it's important to test the strategy on historical data. [Backtesting](https://Felag-academy.org/en/library/what-are-backtests) allows you to identify weaknesses in the strategy and optimize risk management parameters. Most problems related to not understanding where to place stops/takes and the like will be solved at the testing stage.

**How to conduct backtests:**
- **Historical data** — use data for a sufficiently long period (minimum 3-6 months)
- **Different market conditions** — test the strategy in trend, sideways, high volatility
- **Account for fees** — include trading fees in calculations, they significantly affect the result
- **Drawdown analysis** — look not only at profit but also at maximum drawdown
- **Validation** — test on one period, verify on another

## Choosing an Exchange for Bot Trading

Exchange reliability is an important element of risk management. When choosing a platform, pay attention to:

- **Uptime and stability** — frequent API failures can lead to unexecuted orders. More in the article on [exchange uptime and downtime](https://Felag-academy.org/en/library/exchange-uptime-downtime/).
- **Withdrawal limits** — ensure withdrawal limits match your volumes
- **Reputation** — study the exchange's history, user reviews, insurance fund availability
- **API support** — bots need stable API with sufficient request limits
- **Diversification** — don't keep all capital on one exchange, distribute across 2-3 platforms

## Summary

Briefly: the key points are above; use them as a practical checklist and combine with risk management.

## FAQ

**1. How does risk management work in trading?**

It allows you to limit losses, control risk volume, and stably preserve capital in the long term. Main tools: stop-losses, position size, diversification.

**2. Can you trade with bots without risk management?**

You shouldn't. Even if trades are executed automatically, risk parameters are still set manually. Without them, a bot can quickly "drain" the entire capital.

**3. What deposit to margin ratio is optimal?**

For beginners, a 1:1 ratio is recommended: half for bots, half in reserve. As experience grows, you can increase the share of active funds.

**4. How many bots should you use simultaneously?**

It's recommended to distribute capital between several bots (for example, 5 bots with 10% of deposit each) for risk diversification.

**5. How often should risk management settings be reviewed?**

It's recommended to regularly analyze trading results and adjust parameters. When market conditions change or the deposit grows, it makes sense to adapt the settings.

**6. What to do if a bot goes into drawdown?**

Don't panic and don't turn off the bot immediately. Check: has the fundamental situation changed for the asset, is the API working, are limits exhausted. If everything is fine — let the bot complete the cycle.

**7. Should you keep a trade journal when trading with bots?**

Yes, necessarily. A journal helps analyze bot efficiency, find configuration errors, and track progress. You can use specialized platforms like TMM.

**8. How many exchanges to use for diversification?**

For deposits up to $1000, one reliable exchange is enough. For capital of $5000+, it makes sense to split between 2-3 platforms to reduce risks.
