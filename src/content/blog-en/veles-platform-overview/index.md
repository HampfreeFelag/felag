**Veles** — cloud platform for cryptocurrency trading automation. Allows creating trading bots without programming, testing strategies on history, and running them 24/7. If you're just getting started with automation, we recommend reading our [introduction to algo trading](/en/library/algorithmic-trading-intro/) first.

**Important:** Veles does not store funds — trades go directly through your exchange via API keys.

## How Veles Works

### API Keys Connection

**API Keys Requirements:**

1. **Permissions:**
   - **Spot:** Spot market trading
   - **Futures:** Futures trading
   - **Withdrawal:** ❌ NOT needed (disable!)

2. **Security:**
   - Save secret key on creation (shown only once!)
   - Use Veles trusted IPs (if exchange requires)
   - Choose "Veles" app on key creation (lifetime access)

3. **Veles IPs:**
   ```
   5.9.195.106-110, 5.9.200.58-62, 88.198.100.162-166
   ```

**Important:** One connection can be used in multiple bots.

## Veles Bot Types

Veles supports two main types of trading bots:

### 1. Grid Bots

**Principle:** Buys low, sells high within a specified range.

**How it works:**
- You set price range (min/max)
- Veles places buy and sell order grid
- On price movement, bot locks profit on each grid

**Settings:**
- Price range (min/max)
- Number of grids (5-100)
- Position size per grid
- Stop-loss (optional)
- Take-profit (optional)

**For whom:** Sideways market (flat), high volatility.

![Creating Bot Veles](./assets/creating-a-grid-bot.png)

### 2. DCA Bots (Averaging)

**Principle:** Buys at regular intervals or on price drop. Learn more about averaging strategy in our [DCA crypto guide](/en/library/dca-strategy-crypto/).

**How it works:**
- You set base purchase amount
- Bot buys at specified intervals (time or % drop)
- On price growth, locks profit

**Settings:**
- Base purchase amount
- Interval (time or % drop)
- Multiplier (increase purchase on drop)
- Take-profit (when to lock profit)

**For whom:** Long-term investments, position accumulation.

### 3. Futures Bots

**Principle:** Leveraged trading (long/short).

**Settings:**
- Direction (long/short)
- Leverage (2-20x)
- Position size
- Stop-loss / Take-profit

**Risks:** High! Can lose more than deposit with improper risk management.

**For whom:** Experienced traders, position hedging.

## Ready-Made Strategies Veles

**Veles provides a showcase of ready-made strategies** — bot settings that can be copied and launched without deep understanding of indicators.

**Examples from our blog:**

### 1. Prisma 5.5

**Description:** High-frequency strategy for volatile altcoins. Uses oscillator combination for oversold entry.

### 2. Elder 2.0 (Spot)

**Indicators:**

## Backtests

**Veles provides historical data trading simulator** — you can test a strategy before launching with real money.

![Setting Up Backtest Veles](./assets/setting-up-a-backtest.png)

**How backtests work:**
1. Choose strategy and parameters
2. Specify testing period (e.g., 30 days)
3. Launch simulation
4. Get statistics: profit, drawdown, win rate

![Backtest Results Veles](./assets/backtest-results.png)

**Important:** Backtests show how strategy would have worked in the past, but don't guarantee future returns.
