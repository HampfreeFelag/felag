Uptime and downtime are service availability metrics: how long exchange operated without failures and how long it was unavailable. For traders, both platform reputation and infrastructure reliability matter.

This article covers what uptime and downtime are, how they're calculated, what to look for when choosing exchange and how to reduce risks during outages.

## What is Uptime and Downtime

**Uptime** — portion of time when service was available and operated normally. **Downtime** — time when service was unavailable or operated with serious limitations. Simply put: uptime answers "what percentage of time exchange was available," downtime — "how long it didn't work or had interruptions."

Both metrics usually expressed in percentages per period (month, year) or in hours/minutes of downtime. Uptime formula:

**Uptime (%) = (Operating Time / Total Period Time) × 100**

For example, in a month (720 hours) exchange was unavailable for 3 hours. Uptime = (717 / 720) × 100 ≈ 99.58%. Accordingly, downtime — 3 hours or about 0.42% of period.

### What Counts as Downtime

- Complete website or API unavailability (user can't log in or execute request).
- Partial unavailability: individual functions don't work (e.g., only spot or only futures), trading halted with working interface.
- Severe delays (lags) making order execution unreliable or impossible in reasonable time.

Brief technical "hangs" for few seconds may not appear in public statistics, but with frequent repetition they also affect trading quality. Understanding infrastructure reliability helps plan risk distribution and not keep critical positions on single platform.

## Why Traders Should Check Exchange Uptime

During downtime, trader can't fully manage positions: close trade, change stop-loss or cancel order. Price continues moving during this time — with open position this is direct risk. In volatile market, even short outage can lead to undesirable consequences.

**Main risks during outages:**

- **Inability to close position** — price may move against open position while exchange is unavailable.
- **Slippage and execution at worse price** — after restoration, orders may execute with delay and at unfavorable price.
- **API failures** — trading bots and scripts stop receiving data and sending orders; automated strategies (including [DCA](https://felag.online/en/library/dca-strategy-crypto/) or [grid](https://felag.online/en/library/grid-trading-crypto/)) don't execute as planned.
- **Loss of access to funds** — during outage, withdrawals and sometimes transfers between accounts unavailable.

Higher share of trading through exchange and more critical positions — more important to choose platforms with high uptime history and adequate communication during incidents.

**Important:** Don't keep all funds on one exchange. Distribute assets across multiple platforms and cold wallets.

## How Exchange Availability is Measured

Platform reliability assessed from multiple sources.

### Public Status Pages

Many exchanges maintain status page where current state of services (trading, API, withdrawals, web interface) and incident history displayed. From them you can see official version: when outage occurred, which systems affected and when work restored.

**Examples:**
- Binance: status.binance.com
- Bybit: status.bybit.com
- Kraken: status.kraken.com

### Availability Reports

Some exchanges publish monthly or annual reports with uptime percentages for main services. Such figures useful for comparison, but calculation methodology may differ (what exactly counted as "available," which regions and nodes considered).

### Third-Party Monitoring Services

Independent services periodically poll exchange websites and APIs from different points worldwide and build availability charts. They help assess uptime "from outside," but coverage and check frequency vary by service — data should be taken as additional, not sole source.

**Examples:**
- DownDetector — user complaints in real-time
- CryptoStatus — crypto exchange and wallet monitoring

When choosing exchange, reasonable to combine: look at official status, external monitoring, and user reviews about recent incidents. For automated trading, important to choose platforms with 99.5%+ uptime — such available in list of supported exchanges on [Veles](https://veles.finance/invite/washmallay?utm_source=Felag-blog&utm_medium=article-link&utm_campaign=exchange-uptime-downtime).

## Typical Causes of Downtime

**Scheduled maintenance** — system updates, migration, capacity expansion. Usually announced in advance and conducted during low activity hours. Brief windows of unavailability considered planned.

**Overload** — sharp traffic surge (pump, crash, popular asset listing) leads to lags, timeouts or complete unavailability. Architecture and scaling quality manifests in such moments.

**DDoS attacks** — targeted infrastructure overload. Large exchanges usually have protection, but attacks may cause short-term or local failures.

**Internal incidents** — equipment failures, update errors, human factor. By them judged quality of operations and speed of team response.

**Regulatory interventions** — blocks by authorities, requirements to halt trading for specific regions.
