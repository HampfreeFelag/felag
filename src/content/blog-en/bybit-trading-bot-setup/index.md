Automating trading on Bybit lets you trade 24/7 without constantly watching the market. Register at Bybit (referral link) if you don’t have an account yet.

This guide is for connecting **external** bot platforms or services to Bybit via API; Bybit's built-in tools on the exchange do not require API keys. You can use Bybit's built-in bots or connect bots from other automation platforms — for example [Veles](https://veles.finance/invite/washmallay?utm_source=Felag-blog&utm_medium=article-link&utm_campaign=bybit-trading-bot-setup) (referral link: signing up via it benefits both you and us). If you connect an external platform and need help, reach out; contacts are on the [About](/en/about/) page.

Walkthrough: what you need, how to create API keys, how to connect them to your bot platform, and which mistakes to avoid.

## What you need

- a verified **Bybit** account
- funds on the account (for trading and fees)
- **API keys** (to connect an external bot/platform to Bybit)
- a clear **strategy** (grid/DCA, risk rules, asset selection)

## Step 1: Create and verify a Bybit account

If you don’t have an account yet, register and complete KYC so you have higher limits and access to features.

## Step 2: Fund the account

Deposit (commonly USDT/USDC). Then transfer funds from the funding wallet to the trading wallet if needed.

## Step 3: Create an API key (critical security step)

In your Bybit profile:

1. open **API**

2. create a new key (e.g., “Trading Bot”)
3. set permissions:
   - ✅ trading permissions (Spot/Margin, Futures if needed)
   - ❌ **Withdrawals: always OFF**

If possible, restrict by IP (only allow your server IPs).

## Step 4: Connect the API key to your bot

In your bot platform:

- select exchange **Bybit**

- paste **API Key** and **API Secret**

- save and validate the connection

## Step 5: Configure strategy parameters

Common parameters:

- position size / capital allocation per bot
- grid step / number of orders (for grid bots)
- stop-loss / take-profit logic

For risk rules, see **[Risk Management for Crypto Trading Bots](https://felag.online/en/library/risk-management-crypto-trading-bots)** (draft).

## Step 6: Launch and monitor

Track:

- PnL and drawdown
- open positions exposure
- order execution quality (slippage)
- whether market conditions still match the strategy assumptions

Stop the bot if:

- market regime changes drastically
- drawdown hits your limit
- you need to adjust parameters

## Common mistakes

1. **Enabling withdrawals** on API keys
2. using extreme leverage
3. choosing low-liquidity pairs
4. running without clear stop/risk limits

## API key security

To protect your funds, it is recommended to follow these rules:

- ✅ Use two-factor authentication (2FA)
- ✅ Restrict API permissions to only necessary functions
- ✅ Regularly check API key activity
- ✅ Do not store secret keys in plain text
- ✅ Use separate API keys for different platforms or services
- ✅ Revoke unused keys

## FAQ

**1. Is it safe to use API keys to connect external platforms?**

Yes, if permissions are configured correctly: disable withdrawals and use 2FA.

**2. Can I use one API key for multiple platforms or services?**

Technically, yes, but it is recommended to use separate keys for each platform — this makes it easier to control access and revoke only one key in case of a leak.

**3. What if I forgot the API secret key?**

You need to create a new API key. The old key can be revoked in the settings.

**4. What is the minimum amount required for trading via an external platform on Bybit?**

The minimum amount depends on the strategy and trading pair. Usually, $50–100 is enough to start.

**5. Is it possible to trade on Bybit without verification?**

Yes, but with limitations. For full access to exchange features, it is recommended to complete verification.
