**Ethereum** — a decentralized blockchain platform for launching smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike Bitcoin, which was created as digital currency, Ethereum was conceived as a "world computer" for programmable financial operations.

**Why this matters:**

Ethereum enabled the creation of not just cryptocurrencies, but entire financial applications without intermediaries: lending, staking, token swaps, NFTs, and much more.

---

## What Is Ethereum in Simple Terms

**Ethereum** — a blockchain with programmable logic. If Bitcoin is "digital gold" (store of value), then Ethereum is "digital oil" (fuel for applications).

**Real-life example:**

Bitcoin is like a calculator (one function: transfers). Ethereum is like a smartphone (many functions: lending, swaps, games, collectible tokens).

**Key difference:**

- **Bitcoin:** BTC transfer from A to B
- **Ethereum:** Code execution on blockchain (smart contracts)

## Ethereum History: From Idea to ETH 2.0

### 2013-2014: Idea and Launch

**2013:** Vitalik Buterin (19 years old, Russian-Canadian programmer) publishes Ethereum Whitepaper.

**Idea:** Bitcoin is too limited. We need a blockchain with programmable logic.

**2014:** Ethereum crowdfunding.

- Token price: $0.31
- Raised: $18 million in BTC
- Sold: 60 million ETH

**2015:** Main network launch (July 30, 2015).

### 2016-2020: Growth and Problems

**2016:** The DAO — decentralized investment fund.

- Raised $150 million
- Hack due to code vulnerability
- Controversial decision: transaction rollback (hard fork)
- Result: split into Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC)

**2017:** ICO boom (Initial Coin Offering).

- 90% of ICOs launched on Ethereum
- ETH price: $8 (start of year) → $1,400 (end of year)
- Problem: network congestion, high fees

**2020:** DeFi Summer (decentralized finance).

- Launched: Uniswap, Aave, Compound, MakerDAO
- TVL (Total Value Locked): $1 billion → $15 billion
- Problem: fees up to $50-100 per transaction

### 2022: The Merge — Transition to Proof-of-Stake

**September 15, 2022:** Ethereum transitioned from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.

**What changed:**
- Energy consumption: -99.95%
- GPU mining: discontinued
- ETH staking: became available to everyone
- ETH inflation: became deflationary (fee burning)

**What didn't change:**
- Fees: remained high (solution — Layer 2)
- Speed: ~15 transactions per second (solution — sharding in the future)

## How Ethereum Works

### Blockchain and Transactions

**Ethereum blockchain** — a distributed ledger that stores:
- Address balances (ETH)
- Smart contract code
- Contract data (state)

**Transaction** — an action on the network:
- ETH transfer
- Smart contract call
- Contract deployment

**Block time:** ~12 seconds
**Throughput:** ~15 TPS (transactions per second)

### Smart Contracts

**Smart contract** — a program on the blockchain that executes automatically when conditions are met.

**Example:**

Decentralized exchange (DEX):
1. User A wants to swap 1 ETH for USDC
2. User B wants to swap 2000 USDC for ETH
3. Smart contract automatically executes the swap
4. No intermediary, no KYC

**Advantages:**
- Automatic execution (no need to trust a person)
- Transparency (code is open)
- Censorship resistance (no one can shut it down)

**Disadvantages:**
- Code bugs = loss of funds (irreversible)
- Fees for every action
- Difficulty upgrading (contract cannot be modified)

### Gas (Gas) — Network Fee

**Gas** — a unit of computational work measurement in Ethereum.

**Why gas is needed:**
- Spam protection (every operation costs money)
- Payment to miners/validators
- Limiting computational complexity

**How fee is calculated:**

```
Fee = Gas Used × Gas Price
```

**Example:**
- ETH transfer: 21,000 gas
- Complex contract: 100,000-500,000 gas
- Gas Price: 20 gwei (0.00000002 ETH)
- Fee: 21,000 × 20 gwei = 0.00042 ETH (~$1-5 in calm times, $50-100 at peak)

**Gwei** — a unit of gas price measurement (1 gwei = 0.000000001 ETH).

## ETH — Ethereum Token

### Tokenomics ETH

**Token type:** Utility + Governance

**ETH functions:**
1. **Gas payment** — all transactions are paid in ETH
2. **Staking** — collateral for validators (32 ETH for own node)
3. **DeFi collateral** — security for loans, liquidity in pools
4. **Store of value** — "digital oil" + deflationary model

**Emission:**
- **Before The Merge:** ~4.5% annually (mining + staking)
- **After The Merge:** ~0.5% annually (staking only)
- **Burning:** Base fee is burned (EIP-1559)
- **Net inflation:** Can be negative (deflation) with high activity

**Distribution:**
- ~83 million ETH in circulation (March 2026)
- ~28 million ETH staked (33% of supply)
- No hard cap (unlike BTC 21 million)

### Comparison: ETH vs BTC

| Parameter | Bitcoin (BTC) | Ethereum (ETH) |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Goal** | Digital gold | World computer |
| **Emission** | 21 million (hard cap) | Unlimited (deflationary model) |
| **Block** | 10 minutes | 12 seconds |
| **TPS** | ~7 | ~15 |
| **Consensus** | Proof-of-Work | Proof-of-Stake |
| **Staking** | No | Yes (3-5% annually) |
| **Burning** | No | Yes (EIP-1559) |

## Ethereum Staking

### What Is Staking

**Staking** — locking ETH to support network operations and earning rewards.

**How it works:**
1. Validator locks 32 ETH (or less through pools)
2. Validator verifies transactions and creates blocks
3. Validator earns rewards (~3-5% annually)
4. For violations (downtime, malicious behavior) — penalty (slashing)

### Staking Methods

| Method | Min. Amount | Flexibility | Risk | Yield |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------|-------|
| **Own node** | 32 ETH | 28 days to withdraw | Low | 3-5% |
| **Pools (Lido, Rocket Pool)** | 0.01 ETH | Flexible (stETH, rETH) | Medium | 3-4% |
| **Exchanges (Bybit, Binance)** | 0.0001 ETH | Depends on exchange | Medium | 2-4% |

**Popular solutions:**
- **Lido (stETH):** Largest pool, liquid token
- **Rocket Pool (rETH):** Decentralized, lower fees
- **Bybit/Binance:** Simple, but custodial risk

## Ethereum Ecosystem

### DeFi (Decentralized Finance)

**DeFi** — financial applications without intermediaries.

**Categories:**
- **DEX (decentralized exchanges):** Uniswap, SushiSwap, Curve
- **Lending:** Aave, Compound, MakerDAO
- **Staking:** Lido, Rocket Pool, Ankr
- **Derivatives:** dYdX, GMX, Synthetix

**TVL (Total Value Locked):** $50-100 billion (fluctuates)

### NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens)

**NFT** — unique tokens for digital art, collectibles, gaming items.

**Popular standards:**
- **ERC-721:** Unique tokens (CryptoPunks, Bored Apes)
- **ERC-1155:** Semi-fungible tokens (games, collections)

**Marketplaces:** OpenSea, Blur, LooksRare

### Layer 2 (Second Layer Solutions)

**Layer 2** — Ethereum overlays for reducing fees and increasing speed.

**Why Layer 2 is needed:**
- Ethereum: ~15 TPS, fees $1-50
- Layer 2: ~100-4,000 TPS, fees $0.01-0.10

**Layer 2 types:**

**Optimistic Rollups:**
- **Arbitrum:** Largest by TVL ($3-5 billion)
- **Optimism:** Backed by Coinbase (Base built on OP)
- **Base:** Coinbase exchange, rapid growth
- **Mechanics:** Transactions executed off Ethereum, results published on mainnet

**ZK-Rollups:**
- **zkSync Era:** ZK-proofs, fast
- **Starknet:** Cairo language, high performance
- **Polygon zkEVM:** Ethereum compatibility
- **Mechanics:** ZK-proofs of transaction validity

### Layer 2 Solutions Comparison

| Solution | Type | TVL (billions $) | Fees | Withdrawal to Mainnet |
|----------|------|------------------|------|----------------------|
| **Arbitrum** | Optimistic | 3-5 | $0.01-0.10 | 7 days |
| **Optimism** | Optimistic | 1-2 | $0.01-0.10 | 7 days |
| **Base** | Optimistic | 1-2 | $0.01-0.10 | 7 days |
| **zkSync Era** | ZK | 0.5-1 | $0.01-0.05 | Instant |
| **Starknet** | ZK | 0.3-0.5 | $0.01-0.05 | Instant |
| **Polygon zkEVM** | ZK | 0.1-0.3 | $0.01-0.05 | Instant |

**How to start using Layer 2:**
1. Buy ETH on exchange
2. Bridge to L2 via Arbitrum Bridge, Optimism Gateway
3. Use in DeFi (Uniswap, Aave on L2)
4. Fees: $0.01-0.10 per swap

**Advantages:**
- Low fees ($0.01-0.10 vs $1-50)
- High speed (~100-4,000 TPS)
- Ethereum compatibility (same addresses, keys)

**Disadvantages:**
- Need to use bridge (additional step)
- Some protocols not yet ported
- Withdrawal to mainnet can take 7 days (Optimistic)

**Recommendation:** For small amounts (< $1,000) use Layer 2. For large amounts — Ethereum mainnet.

## Ethereum Risks

### 1. Competition

**Problem:** Solana, Cardano, Avalanche offer higher speed and lower fees.

**Ethereum's response:** Layer 2, sharding, continuous upgrades.

### 2. Regulatory Risks

**Problem:** SEC may classify ETH as a security.

**Status:** ETH is currently considered a commodity (like BTC), but the question remains open.

### 3. Technical Risks

**Problem:** Smart contract bugs, bridge vulnerabilities.

**Examples:**
- The DAO (2016): $60 million stolen
- Wormhole (2022): $320 million stolen from Solana-Ethereum bridge

**How to protect yourself:**
- Use audited contracts
- Don't keep everything in one protocol
- Diversify risks

## FAQ

**How much ETH is in circulation?**

~83 million ETH (March 2026). No hard cap, but emission is low (~0.5% annually).

**Can you mine Ethereum?**

No. After The Merge (September 2022), Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake. Mining is impossible.

**What is stETH?**

stETH — liquid staking token from Lido. You receive stETH for locked ETH and can use it in DeFi.

**Is it safe to stake ETH on an exchange?**

Depends on the exchange. Bybit, Binance — reliable, but custodial risk remains. For large amounts — own node or decentralized pools (Lido, Rocket Pool).

**Why are fees so high?**

Ethereum is congested (many users). Solution — Layer 2 (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base), where fees are $0.01-0.10.

**What is EIP-1559?**

Ethereum upgrade (August 2021). Base fee is burned, making ETH deflationary during high activity.
