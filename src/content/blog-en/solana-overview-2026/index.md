**Solana** — a high-performance blockchain for decentralized applications (dApps) with throughput up to 65,000 transactions per second and fees ~$0.00025. Unlike Ethereum, Solana uses a unique Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism to achieve high speed.

**Why this matters:**

Solana solves the scalability problem without Layer 2: one blockchain, high speed, low fees. This attracts DeFi, NFT, gaming, and social app developers.

---

## What Is Solana in Simple Terms

**Solana** — a fifth-generation blockchain built for mass cryptocurrency adoption.

**Real-life example:**

- **Bitcoin:** 7 TPS (like a pedestrian)
- **Ethereum:** 15 TPS (like a bicycle)
- **Solana:** 65,000 TPS (like a high-speed train)

**Key difference:**

Solana uses Proof-of-History (PoH) + Proof-of-Stake (PoS). PoH creates "timestamps" for transactions, allowing thousands of operations to be processed in parallel.

## Solana History: From Idea to Recovery

### 2017-2020: Creation

**2017:** Anatoly Yakovenko (Russian engineer, worked at Qualcomm, Dropbox) publishes Solana Whitepaper.

**Idea:** Blockchains are slow due to time synchronization. We need a mechanism of "built-in clocks".

**2018:** Solana Labs founded.

**2020:** Main network launch (March 2020).

- First transaction
- Initial SOL price: ~$0.22

### 2021: Boom and ATH

**2021:** Year of Solana growth.

- SOL price: $1.50 (January) → $260 (November)
- Launched: Serum (DEX), Magic Eden (NFT), Marinade (staking)
- TVL: $0 → $10 billion

**Problems:**
- Network overheating (high demand)
- First outages (November 2021)

### 2022: FTX and Collapse

**November 2022:** FTX/Alameda collapse.

**Why it hit Solana:**
- SBF (Sam Bankman-Fried) was a major Solana investor
- FTX/Alameda held ~$3-5 billion in SOL
- Market panic, mass selling

**Result:**
- SOL price: $140 → $8 (minus 94%)
- TVL: $10 billion → $200 million
- Recovery took 12+ months

### 2023-2024: Recovery

**2023:** Gradual recovery.

- SOL price: $8 → $120
- Launched new projects: Jupiter (aggregator), Tensor (NFT)
- Developers returned (low fees, high speed)

**2024:** New growth.

- SOL price: $120 → $200+
- Launched: Solana Pay (payments), Saga (smartphone)
- Institutional interest (Visa accepts USDC on Solana)

## How Solana Works

### Proof-of-History (PoH)

**PoH** — a time synchronization mechanism in blockchain.

**Problem of regular blockchains:**

In Bitcoin/Ethereum, validators must "agree" on transaction time. This is slow (10 minutes in BTC, 12 seconds in ETH).

**Solana's solution:**

PoH creates cryptographic "clocks" that automatically timestamp every transaction. Validators don't need to agree — time is already embedded in the data.

**Analogy:**

- **Bitcoin/Ethereum:** Each participant checks clocks with others (slow)
- **Solana:** Everyone has access to atomic clocks (fast)

### Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

**PoS** — a consensus mechanism where validators lock SOL to participate in the network.

**How it works:**
1. Validator locks SOL (collateral)
2. Validator verifies transactions and creates blocks
3. Validator earns rewards (~7% annually)
4. For violations (downtime, malicious behavior) — penalty (slashing)

**Requirements:**
- Minimum SOL for own node: not required (but need votes)
- Delegation: from 0.01 SOL through pools

### Parallel Processing (Sealevel)

**Sealevel** — technology for parallel smart contract execution.

**Ethereum's problem:**

Contracts execute sequentially (one after another). If one contract is slow, everyone waits.

**Solana's solution:**

Contracts that don't conflict execute in parallel. This increases throughput hundreds of times.

**Result:**
- Theoretical limit: 65,000 TPS
- Real: 2,000-4,000 TPS (still 100-200x faster than Ethereum)

## SOL — Solana Token

### SOL Tokenomics

**Token type:** Utility + Governance

**SOL functions:**
1. **Fee payment** — all transactions are paid in SOL
2. **Staking** — collateral for validators
3. **Voting** — participation in governance (SOL = votes)
4. **DeFi collateral** — security for loans, liquidity

**Emission:**
- Initial emission: ~489 million SOL (2020)
- Inflation: 8% (first year), -15% annually until reaching 1.5%
- Current inflation: ~5% annually
- Burning: 50% of fees burned

**Distribution (at launch):**
- 16% — Seed sale (early investors)
- 13% — Founding sale (founders)
- 38% — Validators (rewards)
- 13% — Team
- 10% — Foundation
- 10% — Community & Ecosystem

**In circulation:**
- ~572 million SOL (March 2026, CoinMarketCap data)
- ~340-350 million SOL staked (~60% of circulating supply)

### Comparison: SOL vs ETH

| Parameter | Ethereum (ETH) | Solana (SOL) |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **TPS** | ~15 | ~2,000-4,000 (real), up to 65,000 (theoretical) |
| **Fees** | $1-50 | $0.00025 |
| **Block time** | 12 seconds | 400 milliseconds |
| **Consensus** | PoS | PoH + PoS |
| **Staking** | 3-5% annually | 6-8% annually |
| **Inflation** | ~0.5% (deflation possible) | ~5% (decreasing to 1.5%) |
| **Burning** | 100% of base fee | 50% of fees |

## Solana Staking

### What Is Staking

**Staking** — delegating SOL to a validator to support the network and earn rewards.

**How it works:**
1. Choose a validator (or pool)
2. Delegate SOL (any amount)
3. Earn rewards (~7% annually)
4. Withdrawal: 2-4 days (epoch)

### Staking Methods

| Method | Min. Amount | Flexibility | Risk | Yield |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------|-------|
| **Own node** | Not required (but need votes) | 2-4 days | Low | 7-8% |
| **Pools (Marinade, Jito)** | 0.01 SOL | Flexible (mSOL, jitoSOL) | Medium | 6-7% |
| **Exchanges (Bybit, Binance)** | 0.0001 SOL | Depends on exchange | Medium | 5-7% |

**Popular solutions:**
- **Marinade Finance (mSOL):** Largest pool, liquid token
- **Jito (jitoSOL):** Additional MEV rewards
- **Bybit/Binance:** Simple, but custodial risk

### MEV in Solana

**MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)** — additional validator profit from optimizing transaction order.

**Jito** — the first protocol to share MEV with stakers.

**Yield:**
- Base: ~6-7%
- With MEV: ~7-9%

## Solana Risks

### 1. History of Outages

**Problem:** Solana repeatedly went down (2021-2023).

**Reasons:**
- Network overload (spam transactions)
- Validator client bugs
- Network attacks

**Recent outages:**
- September 2021: 17 hours
- September 2022: 7 hours
- February 2023: 18 hours
- December 2023: 5 hours

**Solution:**
- Validator client improvement
- Rate limiting (spam restriction)
- Fast patch deployment

**Status:** No outages since January 2024.

### 2. Competition

**Problem:** Ethereum Layer 2, Aptos, Sui offer similar advantages.

**Solana's response:**
- Firedancer (new validator client from Jump Crypto)
- Increasing throughput to 1 million TPS
- Partnerships (Visa, Shopify, Google Cloud)

### 3. Regulatory Risks

**Problem:** SEC may classify SOL as a security.

**Status:**
- In SEC lawsuit against Binance/Coinbase, SOL mentioned as a security
- Solana Foundation denies, claims SOL is a utility
- Question remains open

### 4. Dependence on Key Players

**Problem:** Solana Labs, Alameda Research were major SOL holders.

**After FTX collapse:**
- Alameda sold/froze most of their SOL
- Foundation continues to fund the ecosystem
- Decentralization growing (less dependence on single player)

## How to Buy and Store SOL

### Buying SOL

**Methods:**
1. **Crypto exchanges:** Bybit, Binance, Coinbase (simple, but custodial)
2. **DEX:** Jupiter, Raydium (decentralized, but need SOL for gas)
3. **P2P:** LocalCryptos, Bisq (direct from person)
4. **Crypto ATMs:** BitAccess, CoinFlip (cash → SOL)

**Recommendation:** For beginners — exchange (Bybit, Binance). For large amounts — P2P or DEX.

### Storing SOL
