The Stochastic Oscillator is one of the most popular technical analysis indicators, allowing traders to identify moments of price momentum slowdown and find potential market reversal points.

## What is Stochastic and Who Created It

The indicator was developed by George Lane in the late 1950s. The core idea: in an uptrend, the closing price tends toward the upper boundary of the range over a given period, and in a downtrend — toward the lower boundary.

Stochastic measures the position of the current price relative to the price range over a selected period. The result is displayed as two lines oscillating between 0 and 100.

## %K and %D Lines: The Foundation

The indicator consists of two curves:
1. **%K (Fast Line):** The main line showing the current position of price.
2. **%D (Signal Line):** A signal line — a moving average of %K.

### %K Calculation Formula

$$\%K = \frac{C - L_{n}}{H_{n} - L_{n}} \times 100$$

Where C is the closing price, L_n is the low over n periods, H_n is the high over n periods.

### Recommended Settings

For most strategies, including the [ELDER 2.0 spot strategy](https://felag.online/en/library/spot-strategy-elder-20/), the following parameters are used:
- **%K Period:** 14
- **Slowing:** 3
- **%D Period:** 3

## Overbought and Oversold Zones

The key levels on the Stochastic scale are **20** and **80**.

- **Oversold zone (below 20):** Price has fallen too far — a bounce or upward reversal is possible. Classic zone for looking for buys.
- **Overbought zone (above 80):** Price has risen too far — a correction or downward reversal is possible.

## Trading Signals

### 1. Exit from Extreme Zones
The simplest signal — lines exiting extreme zones.
- **Buy (Long):** Lines cross level 20 from below upward.
- **Sell (Short):** Lines cross level 80 from above downward.

### 2. %K and %D Line Crossover
When the fast %K line crosses the slow %D line — confirmation of a change in short-term momentum.

### 3. Divergence
If price makes a new high but Stochastic does not (bearish divergence), it is a strong signal of a possible downward reversal. And vice versa for bullish divergence.

## Use in ELDER 2.0 Strategy

In the [ELDER 2.0](https://felag.online/en/library/spot-strategy-elder-20/) strategy, Stochastic works together with [Bollinger Bands](https://felag.online/en/library/bollinger-bands/) and the [Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO)](https://felag.online/en/library/chande-momentum-oscillator/).

In this system, Stochastic acts as the "trigger": the signal to look for an entry point arises when it drops below 20 — into the deep oversold zone.

| Indicator | Role in ELDER 2.0 |
|---|---|
| Bollinger Bands | Volatility filter |
| CMO | Momentum filter |
| Stochastic | Entry trigger |

## Stochastic vs RSI: Key Differences

| Feature | Stochastic | RSI |
|---|---|---|
| Basis | Price range (H-L) | Closing price changes |
| Lines | 2 (%K and %D) | 1 |
| Sensitivity | Higher | Moderate |
| Best for | Flat and reversals | Trend |

## FAQ

**What Stochastic settings are best for crypto?**

For short-term trading on M15: %K=14, Slowing=3, %D=3. For smoother signals: %K=21, Slowing=5, %D=5.

**Can Stochastic be used in a trend?**

The oscillator tends to give false signals in strong trends. It is recommended to combine with trend filters — for example, [Bollinger Bands](https://felag.online/en/library/bollinger-bands/).

**How is Stochastic different from CMO?**

[CMO](https://felag.online/en/library/chande-momentum-oscillator/) measures pure momentum directly without double smoothing, while Stochastic compares the closing price to the High-Low range.

## Summary

Key indicators such as [Money Flow Index (MFI)](https://felag.online/en/library/money-flow-index/) and [Bollinger Bands](https://felag.online/en/library/bollinger-bands/) complement the analysis, providing a more complete market picture.

The Stochastic Oscillator is an effective tool for finding entry points in the volatile crypto market. Like any oscillator, it can give false signals during strong trends, so it should be used with trend or volatility filters. For automated Stochastic-based strategies, traders often use platforms like [Veles](https://veles.finance/invite/washmallay?utm_source=Felag-blog&utm_medium=article-link&utm_campaign=stochastic-oscillator) — a popular service for running trading bots.
