A trading system is a set of rules: when to enter and exit, how much to risk, how to allocate capital. Without clear rules, decisions become emotional and inconsistent; with rules it’s easier to keep discipline and evaluate results.

In this part — how to build a basic system and align it with diversification from [Part 1](https://felag.online/en/library/diversification-trading-system-part-1/). In [Part 3](https://felag.online/en/library/diversification-trading-system-part-3/) — monitoring, tuning, and common mistakes.

## What is a trading system

A trading system is explicit rules instead of impulses: when to enter and exit, what position size to allow, where to set stop losses and take profits. Without such rules, decisions depend on mood and market noise; one "gut" trade leads to the next and the outcome is hard to evaluate. With rules you can test the system on history ([backtests](https://felag.online/en/library/what-are-backtests/)), compare results with expectations and adjust parameters if needed.

A basic system includes: entry and exit criteria, position size and risk per trade, choice and configuration of bots in line with diversification by assets and venues from [Part 1](https://felag.online/en/library/diversification-trading-system-part-1/).

## Entry and exit rules

Entry criteria come from technical analysis or strategy logic: e.g. support level, indicator signal, or DCA/grid condition. Write them down clearly: “we enter on RSI < 30 and bounce from level,” “DCA triggers every N days on X% price drop.” Exit — by targets (take profit) and stop losses; don’t hold “hoping” if the rule already triggered. If the stop hit — close by the rule, not “wait for a bounce”; otherwise risk gets out of control. Before going live, test rules on history — backtests show how the system would have behaved in the past and what drawdowns are possible.

## Position size and risk per trade

Risk per trade is the share of the deposit you are willing to lose in one trade; from it depend position size and distance to stop loss. Example: $1000 deposit, 1% risk per trade — $10; with a 5% stop from entry price, position size must not lead to more than $10 loss. Set a maximum and don’t exceed it. So one bad trade doesn’t hit the whole capital; a string of losses is also limited. Many recommend no more than 1–2% per trade; with strong diversification, slightly higher risk per idea can be acceptable if overall portfolio risk is under control. For our approach see [risk management in crypto trading](https://felag.online/en/library/risk-management-crypto-trading-bots/).

## Choosing and configuring bots

DCA and [grid trading](https://felag.online/en/library/grid-trading-crypto/) solve different tasks: trigger conditions and limits per bot are set separately. DCA averages entry over time; grid trades in a range. To connect to an exchange you’ll need API keys and an understanding of position limits — step by step in [setting up a bot on Bybit](https://felag.online/en/library/bybit-trading-bot-setup/). Don’t concentrate all volume in one bot: allocation across several strategies and pairs should match diversification by assets and venues from Part 1. Before launch check: position limits don’t exceed your risk per trade and overall portfolio risk.

## Summary

System = entry/exit rules + position size and risk + diversification by assets, strategies, and venues. Next — [Part 3: tuning for yourself and common mistakes](https://felag.online/en/library/diversification-trading-system-part-3/).

## FAQ

**How many strategies to run at once?**

Start with 1–2. When they work stably — add more. 3–5 strategies is usually enough to start.

**How to determine risk per trade?**

1–2% of deposit. With heavy diversification, you can go slightly higher, but overall portfolio risk must be controlled.

**Do I need to test the system on history?**

Yes, required. [Backtests](https://felag.online/en/library/what-are-backtests/) show drawdowns and past system behavior.

**What risk management for DCA bots?**

Risk is calculated on the full position (including averages), not just first entry. Usually 1–2% of deposit.

**Can I run DCA and grid on the same asset?**

Possible, but hard to manage. Better to separate: either DCA or grid on one asset.
