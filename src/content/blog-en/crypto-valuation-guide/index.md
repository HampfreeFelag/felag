**Cryptocurrency valuation** is the process of determining a token's fair value. Unlike traditional stocks, crypto has no single formula. But there's a set of metrics that will help you understand: **is a token overvalued or undervalued**.

This guide covers all valuation methods: from basic (market cap) to advanced (NVT, MVRV, DCF for crypto).

---

## Why Crypto Valuation Differs from Stocks

**Traditional stocks:**
- Have revenue, profit, assets
- Use DCF, P/E, P/B models
- Cash flows are predictable

**Cryptocurrencies:**
- No revenue in the classical sense
- Protocols often don't generate profit
- Value = utility + demand + speculation

**Conclusion:** We need different metrics.

---

## Method 1: Market Cap (Basic)

**Formula:**
```
Market Cap = Token Price × Circulating Supply
```

**Where to check:** CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko

**How to use:**
- Compare with competitors in the same category
- Assess market dominance

**Example:**
| Project | Market Cap | Market Dominance |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| Bitcoin | $1.8T | 58% |
| Ethereum | $380B | 12% |
| Solana | $85B | 2.7% |

**Problem:** Market cap doesn't account for:
- Token unlocks
- Inflation (emission)
- Real utility

**Conclusion:** Use as a **primary filter**, not the only metric.

---

## Method 2: P/S Ratio (Price-to-Sales)

**For which projects:** DeFi, L2, infrastructure (have fees/revenue)

**Formula:**
```
P/S = Market Cap / Annual Protocol Revenue
```

**Where to get data:** Token Terminal, DefiLlama

⚠️ **Important:** For DeFi protocols, "revenue" = protocol fees, but not always token holder earnings. For example, Uniswap collects fees, but fee switch may not be activated.

**Interpretation:**
| P/S | Valuation |
|-----|-----------|
| < 5 | Undervalued (cheap) |
| 5-20 | Fair |
| > 20 | Overvalued (expensive) |

**Example (illustrative data):**
| Project | Revenue (year) | Market Cap | P/S |
|---------|---------------|------------|-----|
| Uniswap | $180M | $4.5B | 25x |
| Aave | $95M | $2.1B | 22x |
| Maker | $120M | $1.8B | 15x |

**Conclusion:** Maker is cheaper than competitors with comparable revenue.

**Limitations:**
- Doesn't work for projects without revenue (L1, memecoins)
- Revenue ≠ profit (protocol can be unprofitable)
- For some protocols, revenue is not distributed to token holders

---

## Method 3: P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings)

**For which projects:** Protocols with profit (Maker, some L2s)

**Formula:**
```
P/E = Market Cap / Net Earnings (Protocol Earnings)
```

**Where to get data:** Token Terminal ("Earnings" section)

⚠️ **Important:** P/E for crypto protocols is a conditional metric. Earnings depend on tokenomics (burns, fee distribution, emission).

**Interpretation:**
| P/E | Valuation |
|-----|-----------|
| < 15 | Undervalued |
| 15-30 | Fair |
| > 30 | Overvalued |

**Example (illustrative data):**
- **Maker (MKR):** P/E = 18x → fair
- **Protocol with stable revenue:** P/E = 25x → above average

**Limitations:**
- Works only for protocols with stable earnings
- Many crypto projects are unprofitable or don't distribute earnings
- P/E is highly volatile in crypto

---

## Method 4: NVT Ratio (Network Value-to-Transactions)

**For which projects:** L1 (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana)

**Formula:**
```
NVT = Market Cap / Transaction Volume (24h, in $)
```

**Analogy:** P/E for blockchains

**Where to get data:** Glassnode, CoinMetrics

⚠️ **Important:** NVT for high-throughput networks (Solana, Sui) may be understated due to high transaction volume (including spam, MEV bots). Compare NVT only within similar architecture networks.

**Interpretation:**
| NVT | Valuation |
|-----|-----------|
| < 20 | Network undervalued (high transactions) |
| 20-50 | Fair |
| > 50 | Network overvalued (low transactions) |

**Example (illustrative data):**
| Network | Market Cap | Volume (24h) | NVT |
|---------|------------|-------------|-----|
| Bitcoin | $1.8T | $45B | 40x |
| Ethereum | $380B | $12B | 32x |
| Solana | $85B | $8B | 11x |

**Conclusion:** Solana is cheaper by NVT, but consider transaction quality (Solana has many high-frequency operations).

**Limitations:**
- Volume volatility (can be abnormally high/low)
- Doesn't account for L2 transactions (for Ethereum)
- Different transaction quality across networks

---

## Method 5: MVRV Ratio (Market Value-to-Realized Value)

**For which projects:** Bitcoin, Ethereum (have on-chain data)

**Formula:**
```
MVRV = Market Cap / Realized Cap
```

**Realized Cap:** Sum of all coins' value at last transaction price

**Where to get data:** Glassnode, CryptoQuant

⚠️ **Important:** MVRV > 3 doesn't always mean market peak — in bull cycles the metric can stay above 3 for extended periods. MVRV < 1 indicates accumulation zone, but doesn't guarantee immediate reversal.

**Interpretation:**
| MVRV | Valuation |
|------|-----------|
| < 1 | Token undervalued (market at loss, accumulation zone) |
| 1-2 | Fair |
| > 3 | Token overvalued (market at profit, correction possible) |

**Example (Bitcoin, historical data):**
- MVRV < 1 → often coincided with market bottom
- MVRV > 3 → often preceded corrections

**Limitations:**
- Works only for Bitcoin and large L1s
- Requires on-chain data
- In bull cycles can stay > 3 for long periods

---

## Method 6: Competitor Comparison (Comps)

**Steps:**

1. **Choose category:**
   - L1: Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche
   - DEX: Uniswap, Curve, PancakeSwap
   - Lending: Aave, Compound, Maker

2. **Collect metrics:**
   - Market cap
   - Revenue (if available)
   - TVL (for DeFi)
   - Active addresses (for L1)

3. **Compare:**

**Example (L1, March 2026):**
| Project | Market Cap | TVL | P/S | Active Addresses (24h) |
|---------|------------|-----|-----|------------------------|
| Ethereum | $380B | $55B | 32x | 450K |
| Solana | $85B | $8B | 11x | 1.2M |
| Avalanche | $15B | $1.5B | 18x | 85K |

**Conclusion:** Solana is cheaper by P/S and more active by addresses.

---

## Method 7: DCF for Crypto (Discounted Cash Flow)

**For which projects:** Protocols with predictable income (stablecoins, staking)

**Formula:**
```
Value = Σ (Cash Flow / (1 + discount rate)^year)
```

**Example (Lido):**
- Annual income: $100M
- Discount rate: 15%
- Horizon: 5 years

```
Value = 100/1.15 + 100/1.15² + ... + 100/1.15⁵ = $335M
```

**Limitations:**
- Hard to predict cash flows
- Doesn't work for volatile projects

---

## Red Flags of Overvaluation

⚠️ **Important:** Don't use a single metric. If 2+ red flags below — token is overvalued, high risk to buy.

**Check the token if:**

1. **P/S > 50** with growth < 20% year-over-year
2. **Market cap > $1B**, but TVL < $100M
3. **Unlocks > 20%** of tokens in next 6 months
4. **Team sold > 5%** of tokens in a month
5. **NVT > 100** (for L1)

**Example:**
- Token with $2B cap, $10M revenue → P/S = 200x ❌
- 30% token unlock in a month → price pressure ❌

---

## Checklist: 5-Minute Valuation

**Quick token check:**

- [ ] Market cap: top 200? (otherwise high risk)
- [ ] P/S: < 20? (for DeFi)
- [ ] NVT: < 50? (for L1)
- [ ] Unlocks: < 10% per year?
- [ ] Competitors: cheaper or more expensive?
- [ ] Revenue: growing or falling?

**If 2+ red flags — skip.**

## Practice: Let's Value Bitcoin and Ethereum

⚠️ **Important:** Data is illustrative. P/S for Bitcoin is not a classic metric — it's the ratio to network fees. For "digital gold", high P/S is historical norm during growth periods.

### Bitcoin (illustrative data)

| Metric | Value | Valuation |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Market Cap | $1.8T | — |
| NVT | 40x | ✅ Fair |
| MVRV | 2.1 | ✅ Fair |
| P/S (via fees) | ~100x | ⚠️ Above historical average |

**Conclusion:** Bitcoin is fairly valued by on-chain metrics. High P/S via fees is normal for growth periods (high network activity).

### Ethereum (illustrative data)

| Metric | Value | Valuation |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Market Cap | $380B | — |
| NVT | 32x | ✅ Fair |
| P/S (network fees) | 32x | ⚠️ Above average |
| TVL / Market Cap | 14% | ✅ Good |

**Conclusion:** Ethereum is fairly valued, but P/S is higher than competitors (Solana). Note that part of fees are burned (EIP-1559).

## Case Study: L1 vs DeFi Protocol Valuation

**Task:** Compare two project types for investment.

⚠️ **Important:** Data is illustrative. Always check current metrics at the time of analysis.

### L1 (Solana)

| Metric | Value | Valuation |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Market Cap | $85B | Top 5 |
| NVT | 11x | ✅ Cheap |
| P/S (network fees) | ~50x | ⚠️ Above average |
| Active Addresses (24h) | 1.2M | ✅ High activity |
| TVL | $8B | ✅ Growing |
| Unlocks (6 months) | 8% | ✅ Low |

**Conclusion:** Solana is cheaper by NVT, high activity, but consider transaction quality (many high-frequency operations).

### DeFi (Maker)

| Metric | Value | Valuation |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Market Cap | $1.8B | Top 50 |
| P/S | 15x | ✅ Fair |
| P/E | 18x | ✅ Fair |
| Revenue (year) | $120M | ✅ Growing |
| TVL | $5B | ✅ Stable |
| Unlocks (6 months) | 5% | ✅ Low |

**Conclusion:** Maker generates revenue, fairly valued, but slower growth than L1.

**Summary:**
- **Conservative:** Maker (has revenue, P/E 18x)
- **Aggressive:** Solana (address growth, NVT 11x)
- **Ideal:** 50/50 portfolio (diversification)

## Common Valuation Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Looking Only at Market Cap

**Problem:** Market cap doesn't account for unlocks.

**Example:**
- Token A: $500M, no unlocks
- Token B: $500M, 40% of tokens unlock in a month

**Solution:** Always check Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) and unlock calendar.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Comparing L1 and DeFi by One Metric

**Problem:** L1 has no revenue (NVT), DeFi has no transactions (P/S).

**Example:**
- Solana: NVT 11x (cheap), P/S N/A
- Maker: P/S 15x (fair), NVT N/A

**Solution:** Use different metrics for different categories.

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Ignoring TVL

**Problem:** TVL shows user trust.

**Example:**
- Token A: P/S 10x, TVL $50M
- Token B: P/S 15x, TVL $500M

**Solution:** TVL / Market Cap > 10% is a good sign.

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Buying on Hype

**Problem:** Metrics are inflated during hype.

**Example:**
- Token in January: P/S 20x, March hype: P/S 100x
- After hype: P/S 10x (minus 90%)

**Solution:** Buy when P/S < 20, NVT < 50, MVRV < 2.

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: No Stop-Loss

**Problem:** Valuation can be wrong.

**Solution:**
- Stop-loss: -20% from entry
- Rebalance: quarterly
- Exit: if P/S > 50, NVT > 100, MVRV > 3

## Summary

**Key takeaways:**
1. No single formula — use a **combination of metrics**
2. Compare with **competitors** in the same category
3. Watch for **unlocks**
4. Check **red flags** before buying

**Optimal approach:**
- L1: NVT + MVRV + competitor comparison
- DeFi: P/S + TVL + revenue
- Memecoins: only market cap and volume (rest doesn't work)

## FAQ

**What is fair token value?**

It's the price that corresponds to the project's real utility and earnings. If market price is above fair value — token is overvalued (expensive). If below — undervalued (cheap).

**Which metric is best for Bitcoin valuation?**

Use **NVT** and **MVRV** for Bitcoin. NVT shows the ratio of market cap to transaction volume (P/E analogy). MVRV compares market price to realized value (at last transaction). NVT 20-50 and MVRV 1-2 are considered fair.

**Does P/E work for memecoins?**

Classic memecoins without utility model don't generate revenue — P/E is not applicable. However, by 2026 there are memecoins with fee distribution models (e.g., memecoin + DeFi). For such projects, P/E can be calculated, but this is rather an exception.

**Where to check token unlocks?**

Use CoinMarketCap Token Unlocks or CryptoRank. The "Token Unlocks" section shows the token release schedule: how much, when, and to whom (team, investors, fund).

**What to do if a token is overvalued?**

If 2+ metrics show overvaluation (P/S > 50, NVT > 100, MVRV > 3), skip the purchase. Wait for a correction or find an alternative in the same category with better metrics.

**Can I use one metric for valuation?**

No. Each metric has limitations. Use a combination: for L1 — NVT + MVRV + competitor comparison; for DeFi — P/S + TVL + revenue.

**Why are token unlocks important?**

Unlocks create price pressure. If 20-30% of tokens hit the market at once, investors and the team may start selling. Check the unlock calendar before buying.
