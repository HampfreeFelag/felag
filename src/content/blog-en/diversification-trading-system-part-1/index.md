Diversification is spreading capital and risk: across assets, strategies, and venues. One position, one bot, or one exchange can fail; diversification does not guarantee profit but reduces the chance of losing everything to a single factor.

In this part — why to diversify and what to look at first. In [Part 2](https://Felag-academy.org/en/library/diversification-trading-system-part-2/) — how to set entry/exit rules and configure bots; in [Part 3](https://Felag-academy.org/en/library/diversification-trading-system-part-3/) — monitoring, tuning, and common mistakes.

## Why traders diversify

Concentrating risk in one asset, one strategy, or one venue increases the impact of a drawdown: if one part of the system “fails,” all capital is at risk. Example: all capital in one altcoin — a crash in that asset means maximum drawdown on the account; all capital on one exchange — during long downtime or withdrawal issues, access to funds is limited. Diversification does not remove risk but spreads it: the hit is to a share of capital, not the whole deposit.

A useful metaphor is a **conveyor**: several lines; one stops — the others keep running. Several bots and assets give the same effect: one line dips — the others continue. The goal is not "run everything at once" but to spread capital and limits consciously.

## Starting with a small budget

You can start with a small amount — e.g. $20. The idea is to test the system on a small budget first, then scale. A 1:1 split: half for bots, half in reserve (margin). So if one part draws down, you still have a buffer for top-ups or living expenses.

**Example:** $20 available. $10 for bots, $10 in reserve. You can test the system across many assets but with a limit on simultaneous entries. On algo-trading platforms (e.g. Veles) there is **position locking**: no more bots enter a trade than your settings allow. You may have 10, 20 or 30 bots in the list, but with lock “1” only one works at a time — the one that got the signal first. This lowers risk: you don’t spread the budget across all assets at once but check logic and risk on one conveyor line. When the system is clear and results are stable, you can gradually increase locks and size.

## Diversification by assets

Better not keep all capital in one asset: correlations between coins are high but not 100% — a drawdown in one asset hits a share of the portfolio, not the whole deposit. When one altcoin crashes, other positions (e.g. BTC, ETH or another asset) may behave differently. Core assets like BTC and ETH are the base of many portfolios; for more on crypto basics see [Bitcoin basics](https://Felag-academy.org/en/library/bitcoin-basics/). Set shares and limits per asset in advance and don't exceed them: e.g. no more than 20–30% of the deposit in one asset, the rest spread.

## Diversification by strategies and bots

Don’t concentrate all volume in one bot or one strategy: [DCA](https://Felag-academy.org/en/library/dca-strategy-crypto/) and [grid trading](https://Felag-academy.org/en/library/grid-trading-crypto/) solve different tasks and behave differently in different market conditions. DCA averages entry over time; grid works in a range. In a strong trend one strategy may draw down, another profit; in a sideways market — the opposite. Spreading capital across several bots and strategies reduces dependence on one “conveyor line.” For capital rules see [risk management in crypto trading](https://Felag-academy.org/en/library/risk-management-crypto-trading-bots/).

## Diversification by venues

Better not keep all volume on one exchange: uptime, withdrawal limits, and reputation matter. During long downtime or withdrawal issues access to funds is limited; if everything is on one venue — risk is higher. What to look for when choosing and how to assess reliability — in the article on [exchange uptime and downtime](https://Felag-academy.org/en/library/exchange-uptime-downtime/).

**Diversification by subaccounts**

Advanced level of diversification — using multiple subaccounts on one exchange or across different venues. This gives additional advantages:

- **Strategy separation** — different subaccounts for DCA, grid, and hybrid bots
- **Risk control** — limits per subaccount separately
- **Scaling** — ability to increase number of assets without growing risk
- **Isolation** — problems on one subaccount don't affect others

At Market Lab, we use 3-4 subaccounts with a total of 200+ assets — this allows testing new strategies without risk to the main portfolio.

## Summary

Diversification is part of setting up a trading system, not an end in itself. The goal is to reduce the risk of losing all capital due to one asset, one strategy, or one venue.

## FAQ

**How many assets do I need for diversification?**

Minimum 3-5 assets. Ideally 7-10 in a portfolio. The key is not just quantity, but that assets are uncorrelated or weakly correlated.

**Can I diversify with a small deposit ($50-100)?**

Yes, but with limitations. Use 1-2 assets and 1-2 bots. Don't spread too thin across many assets with minimal positions — it gives a false sense of security.

**Same strategies on different assets — is that diversification?**

Partially. It's diversification by assets, but not by strategies. If all bots use the same logic, market condition failures will affect all positions simultaneously.

**Do I need to diversify across exchanges with $100 deposit?**

While deposit is small, better focus on one reliable exchange. With $500-1000 it makes sense to split between 2 exchanges. Over-splitting creates extra work and complicates monitoring.

**How often to review diversification?**

Every 1-3 months or after major market changes. Check: hasn't one asset's share grown? Has correlation changed? Do you need to add new assets?
