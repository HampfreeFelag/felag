Trading without records is like sailing without a map: you can move, but it's unclear where and why. A trading journal helps you track trades, analyze mistakes, and monitor progress. In this article, we cover why you need a trading journal, how to maintain one, and what tools to use.

## What is a Trading Journal

**Trading Journal** is a systematic record of all trades, decisions, and observations related to trading. It helps you rely on objective data for analysis rather than memory.

**What to record in a journal:**
- Date and time of the trade
- Asset, direction (long/short), volume
- Entry and exit prices
- Result (profit/loss)
- Reasons for entry and exit
- Emotional state
- Mistakes and takeaways

## History: From Chalkboards to Digital Platforms

Trade tracking has existed as long as trading itself.

**Trading Floor Era (19th — mid-20th century)** — Chicago and New York stock exchanges used **chalkboards** to write quotes and trade volumes in real time. Traders kept paper journals, writing down each operation by hand. This required discipline and attention but gave a complete picture of the trading day.

**Personal Computers (1980s — 2000s)** — with the advent of PCs, traders switched to spreadsheets. Excel became the standard: automatic calculations, charts, analysis by periods.

**Specialized Platforms (2010s — present)** — today there are ready-made solutions:
- **TraderMake.Money** — automatic statistics collection via exchange APIs
- **Edgewonk** — advanced analytics and psychological metrics
- **Tradervue** — social platform for sharing trades
- **Google Sheets / Excel** — custom solutions

At Market Lab, we use [TMM](https://tradermake.money/trader/Felag?page=1#OXMme8) — you can track detailed public statistics of our test setups on one of our subaccounts.

## Why You Need a Trading Journal

### 1. Error Analysis

Human memory is selective: we tend to remember successful trades and forget losing ones. A journal shows an objective picture:

- Which setups work better/worse
- Where risk management rules are broken
- What mistakes are repeated

**Example:** you notice that 70% of losses come from trades opened in the first 2 hours after the market wakes up. Conclusion: trade later, when volatility stabilizes.

### 2. Progress Tracking

A journal lets you see dynamics:

- Win rate (percentage of successful trades)
- Average profit and average loss
- Maximum drawdown
- Overall profitability by periods

**Important:** evaluate results not by individual trades, but by series (week, month, quarter).

### 3. Discipline Control

Recording each trade creates accountability. When you know you'll have to write "broke stop-loss due to greed," it's harder to deviate from the plan.

### 4. Strategy Optimization

Accumulated data is the basis for backtests and fine-tuning:

- Which indicators give better signals
- Which timeframes suit your style
- How to adjust parameters when market conditions change

## Journal Formats

### Paper Journal

**Pros:**
- Information is better remembered when written by hand
- No distractions (notifications, internet)
- Works as psychological relief

**Cons:**
- No automatic calculations
- Hard to analyze large volumes of data
- Risk of loss or damage

**Who it's for:** beginners forming discipline, traders with few trades per day.

### Spreadsheets (Excel / Google Sheets)

**Pros:**
- Flexible customization to your needs
- Automatic formulas for statistics
- Accessibility (Google Sheets — free)

**Cons:**
- Takes time to set up
- No automatic trade import
- Need to manually update data

**Who it's for:** traders who want full control over data structure.

### Specialized Platforms (TMM and similar)

**Pros:**
- Automatic trade import via API
- Ready-made analytics and charts
- Synchronization with multiple exchanges
- History preservation when changing brokers

**Cons:**
- May have subscription fee (usually $20-50/month)
- Less flexibility in field customization
- Requires trust in the platform (API access)

**Who it's for:** active traders, users of multiple exchanges, those who value time.

## How to Analyze Entries

### Weekly Review

Once a week, it's useful to review:

- **Total PnL** — profit/loss for the week
- **Win rate** — percentage of successful trades
- **Largest profit/loss** — which trades gave maximum results
- **Repeated mistakes** — what hinders stability

### Monthly Report

Once a month — deeper analysis:

- **Deposit dynamics** — capital change chart
- **Setup statistics** — which signals work better
- **Asset statistics** — which pairs you trade more successfully
- **Time statistics** — what time of day results are better

### Working on Mistakes

After analysis — action plan:

1. Identify 1-2 key mistakes
2. Determine how to avoid them (rules, filters, limitations)
3. Implement changes in trading system
4. Check results in a week

## Integration with Risk Management

A trading journal is an integral part of the risk management system:

- **Trade risk control** — recording helps not to exceed the limit
- **Drawdown tracking** — you see when to reduce volumes
- **Stop-loss discipline** — recording all losses, no "heroism"
- **Risk/reward analysis** — statistics for optimization

## Common Mistakes When Keeping a Journal

- **Irregularity** — entries "when I remember." A journal only works with systematic maintenance.
- **Incomplete data** — missing entry/exit reasons, emotions, takeaways.
- **Analysis without action** — collected statistics but changed nothing.
- **Focus on profit** — looking only at profit, ignoring mistakes.
- **Lack of honesty** — writing "no mistakes" when there were.

## Summary

A trading journal is a tool for discipline and analysis. It doesn't guarantee profit, but provides data for decision-making. Format (paper, Excel, platform) is a matter of preference. The main thing is regularity and honesty.

**Key takeaways:**
- Record all trades: entry, exit, reasons, emotions
- Analyze statistics weekly and monthly
- Use data to optimize your strategy
- Don't hide mistakes — they're growth points

## FAQ

**Is it necessary to keep a journal for beginners?**

Yes, especially for beginners. It helps form discipline and not repeat mistakes. At the start, it's more important to learn to record and analyze than to earn.

**How much time does keeping a journal take?**

5-10 minutes per trade with manual entry. With automatic platforms (TMM) — almost zero, only analysis.

**What's better: paper, Excel, or a platform?**

Depends on trading style. Beginners — paper or Excel to understand structure. Active traders — platforms with auto-import.

**Should you record emotions?**

Yes. Emotions affect decisions. If you see a pattern "after a loss I want to win back — break rules," it will help change behavior.

**How long to keep records?**

Minimum a year — for seasonality and long-term results assessment. Better — indefinitely, it's your growth history.

**Can you use multiple formats?**

Yes. For example, TMM for automatic import + paper journal for notes and reflection.

**Is a public journal safe?**

Yes, if you use view-only API keys. Never give keys with withdrawal rights.
