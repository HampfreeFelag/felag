### Grid Calculator

- Calculates number of grids within specified range
- Shows profit per grid
- Optimizes parameters for deposit

**How to use:**
1. Set price range (min/max)
2. Specify deposit
3. Get optimal grid count and profit

**Example:**
- Range: $90,000 - $100,000 (BTC)
- Deposit: $200
- Result: 10 grids, ~$2-5 profit per grid

- Calculates position averaging levels
- Shows average entry price
- Optimizes averaging step

**How to use:**
1. Set base purchase amount
2. Specify averaging step (% or fixed)
3. Get entry levels table

**Example:**
- Base purchase: $50
- Averaging step: 5% drop
- Multiplier: 1.5x
- Result: 5 levels, average entry 12% below current

### Community Calculator
